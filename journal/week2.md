# Week 2 â€” Distributed Tracing

Table of Contents


## Technical Tasks
The fractional CTO has suggested that we implement distributed tracing first because as we begin to add cloud services it will become difficult to pinpoint issues and we want to keep pace with the (probably unrealistic) development timeline.

- Instrument our backend flask application to use Open Telemetry (OTEL) with Honeycomb.io as the provider
- Run queries to explore traces within Honeycomb.io
- Instrument AWS X-Ray into backend flask application
- Configure and provision X-Ray daemon within docker-compose and send data back to X-Ray API
- Observe X-Ray traces within the AWS Console
- Integrate Rollbar for Error Logging
- Trigger an error an observe an error with Rollbar
- Install WatchTower and write a custom logger to send application log data to CloudWatch Log group
